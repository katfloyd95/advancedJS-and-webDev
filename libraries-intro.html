    <h1>Libraries are really amazing</h1>
    <ol class = "container">
      <li>What are libraries?</li>
      <p>The same way we import files from out directory such as index.js etc., we can do the same with files from the internet. This can be done in two different ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Download the library files and throw them into your directory with your index.html file</li>
        <li>
          Download the files directly from a URL or a CDN, which is a server that is hosting the file somewhere, and you point your script tag to that 
        URL
        </li>
        <br>
      </ul>
      <li>What is a CDN?</li>
        <p>A server that hosts the file you want to use somwehere, to which you point your script tag</p>
      <li>Bootstrap CSS</li>
        <p>Boot strap gives us some JS and CSS code that allows us to develop FASTER</p>
      <li>JQuery JS</li>
        <ul>
          <li>A fast, small feature-rich JS Library</li>
          <li>It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and AJAX much simpler than an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
      <li>More Advanced Libraries</li>
        <ul>
          <li>React</li>
          <p>React works with Polaris on Shopify, which is like Bootstrap but for React instead of CSS</p>
        </ul>
    </ol>
